Hi! I’m excited to join the **ETH Robotics Club** — I love building real systems, iterating fast, and working with strong teams.

## Featured projects
- **MARBLES VR** — Fully hand-tracked **VR/AR** game. Qualified for **ISEF 2023** and placed **4th (Computer Science)**.  
- **MIRAS** — End-to-end, self-built **modular robotics system** (3 years). Won **Gold @ TISF 2025** and led to participation at **CATSIC 2025**.  
- **DelightRelight Benchmark** — First draft completed **three weeks ago**: benchmark for detecting AI-generated videos using **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction**.  
  → PDFs are available in **Project Papers**.

## Team / competitive builds
- **VisCon Hackathon 2025** — **3rd place**

## What I want to do at ETH RC
Build ambitious, real-world robotic systems with a great team — and contribute wherever needed: **mechanical**, **electronics**, **software**, or **system integration**. 🔥
