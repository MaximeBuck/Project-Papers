# Portofolio

Here are my latest projects and why I’m excited to join the Robotics Club:

	•	MARBLES VR — a fully hand-tracked VR/AR game that qualified me for ISEF 2023, where I placed 4th in Computer Science.
	•	MIRAS — an end-to-end, self-built modular robotics system (3 years). It won Gold at TISF 2025 and got me to CATSIC 2025.
	•	DelightRelight Benchmark — first draft finished three weeks ago: a benchmark for detecting AI videos using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction.
You can find the pdf's under project papers.

I also love building under pressure and working in teams:
	•	VisCon Hackathon 2025— my most recent hackathon; we took 3rd place: https://github.com/TheOverflows-VISCON2025/viscon-hackathon-project

I’ve worked across the full robotics stack:
	•	CANSAT 2023 — we built a mini satellite: https://www.esero.lu/cansat-competition-luxembourg-2023-🚀/?lang=en

I competed in a science challenge show on Luxembourg TV:
	•	Take Off (Season 2) — finished 2nd place: https://www.youtube.com/@takeoffshow_lu

My aims at ETH RC are to build real systems with a strong team, learn fast, and contribute wherever needed (mechanical, electronics, software, or integration). 🔥
